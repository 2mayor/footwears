  <p class="highlight">L.E.K. Consulting has released its Fourth Annual Brand Heat Index,
     again measuring and announcing the brands that have gained in popularity
      across major product categories in footwear and apparel.</header>

        <h2>TYPES OF MAKER</h2>
      He said the intent from the insights provided by the Brand 
Heat Index brings a more nuanced view of brand trajectory and what
 drives it up, which should ultimately enhance retailer’s strategic decision-making.
“Our Brand Heat Index continues to demonstrate how material differences in brand </br>
</p>
<p>momentum can exist below the surface and how quickly sentiment can change,” 
the company said in its report summary. “Once again, generational differences 
in top brand rankings point to the importance of recognizing that consumers are not 
all the same and that deep understanding and tailored strategies are required to win.”
  </p></br>

<p>L.E.K. Consulting based its Brand Heat Index on a survey of nearly 5,000 U.S. 
consumers between the ages of 14 and 55. Within product categories and generational 
cohorts, each brand earns a heat score expressed on a scale of 0 to 100 — the higher
 the score, the hotter the brand.</p>
</br>

<p>Notably, the Brand Heat Index identifies brands on the most significant upward trajectory
 with consumers, not necessarily the brands’ relative size or scale.

The survey gathers feedback on brands across four product categories: Athletic, Casual, 
Outdoor/Rugged and Dress. SGB Media focuses on the athletic, casual, outdoor/rugged 
categories for this review and write-up.</br>
</p>

<p>The brands with the most heat are not necessarily the biggest or fastest-growing; 
it’s about connection with the core consumer.

“In 2025, competition in the footwear space remains intense, with brand heat scores
 tightly clustered among the top three brands across categories,” L.E.K. wrote.
  “Consumers continue to be driven by iconic silhouettes and a blend of form and 
  function, as demonstrated by the popularity of athletic brands and comfort-driven 
  brands (e.g., Crocs, HeyDude, Ugg) in casual footwear,” the company wrote.</p>
