  <p class="highlight">Nike has reclaimed the top spot from On, but these two brands 
    and Hoka all sit within three points of one another in the overall
     rankings.</p>
     <p class="highlight"> From a generational perspective, On takes the top spot among Gen Z,
      Nike among millennials and Hoka among Generation X.
While Adidas remains at the same ranking as last year (No. 5 overall), the brandâ€™s
 heat score has improved across all generations, likely due to the popularity of its
  Samba model and other key fashion styles.</p>
  <p>New Balance (No. 6 overall) has similarly increased its score across all generations 
of women. Under Armour and Reebok, on the other hand, have dropped spots, with Reebok
 falling out of the top 10 entirely.
